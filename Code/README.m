% This is a matlab code for Non-negative Matrix Factorization via Nesterov's
% Optimal Gradient Method.

% In this project we have applied random projections to the aforementioned
% technique via two variants of random projections,namely:

% 1. Randomized Power iterations RPI NeNMF
% 2. Randomized Subspace Iterations RSI NeNMF

% HOW TO RUN THE CODE.
%
% Step 1: run the file "add_paths", to ensure all the folders and files are added to your matlab working path.
% Step 2: run the file "data_simulations", to generate your synthetic data.
% step 3: run the file "Demo" to execute the functions available in the folder "algorithms"

% Results of the execution are saved in the folder "output"

% To make plots, use the file "plots".
